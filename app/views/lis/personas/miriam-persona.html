      <p>
        My name is Miriam and I am 62 years old. I live in a small house with my son Thomas who is 30 and works as a building site labourer.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        I live on an occupational pension from my job and my state pension.
      </p>

      <p>
        My husband Bob died 5 years ago and his life insurance covered 80% of our mortgage leaving me Â£175 to pay each month, which I 
can manage. I rely on my small amount of savings for unexpected costs which lately there have been quite a few of.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am about to have some serious dental treatment and a friend recommended the schemeto me.
