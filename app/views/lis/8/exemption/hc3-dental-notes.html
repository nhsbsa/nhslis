  <li>the amount we have written by Box overleaf, or</li>
  <li>in Scotland the maximum patientâ€™s charge - your dentist will be able to tell you how much this is.</li>
  <p>On the form your dentist asks you to sign, write the number of this certificate and the amount from your certificate.</p>
  <p><strong>Dental examinations are free to all in Scotland.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>NHS wigs and fabric supports</strong> - for each wig or fabric support the most you have to pay is the amount the amount on your certificate. <strong>The amount you have to pay could be lower than the cost of the wig or fabric support if the NHS charge is less</strong> - the person fitting the wig or fabric support can tell you how much this is.</p>
  <p><strong>NHS wigs and fabric supports are free where prescribed and dispensed in Scotland.</strong></p>
