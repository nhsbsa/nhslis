        <li><span class="strong">What we plan to test: </span> </li>
        <li>Full end to end journey for a pensioner who has a state, private pension or both.</li>
        <li>Lives in their own home and pays council tax. </li>
        <li>This pensioner has some entitlement and has a working, non-dependant son living in the household, no benefits.</li>
      </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="strong">What we changed:<br> </span></li>
          <li>Updated the <a href="lis/2/full-help">end screen</a> because users didn't feel they were 'done'.</li>
          <li>Added visual feedback on the <a href="lis/2/lis-home4">hub screen</a> to show a section was complete.</li>
          <li>Added <a href="lis/2/assets/accounts">savings accounts</a> and amended the text so that the <a href="lis/2/assets/money">savings options</a> were hopefully clearer.</li>
          <li>Added ability to <a href="lis/2/live/others/people">tell us that someone else lives in your home</a> and their circumstances.</li>
          <li>Enabled the prototype to allow the user to select <a href="lis/2/live/home">in a home I own</a> and tailored the questions based on this choice.</li>
          <li>Enabled the prototype to handle a users' choice of <a href="lis/2/you/pension/pension-type">pensions</a> and only ask the relevant question based on their choice.</li>
          <li>Added a <a href="lis/2/part-help">partial help screen</a></li>
          <li>Added text to the <a href="lis/2/live/rent">rent amount screen</a> to explain the amount a user should enter.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="heading-large">Alpha sprint 1</h2>
      <p>Created mid May 2016</p>

      <ul>
        <li><span class="strong">What we tested: </span> </li>
        <li>Full end to end journey for a pensioner who has a state and a private pension, rents their home and pays council tax. </li>
        <li>This pensioner has full entitlement and there are no others in household, no benefits.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="strong">What we found: </span></li> 
        <li>Overall, users found this easy to use.</li> 
        <li>Biggest issues were around:</li> 
        <li>1) known issues below</li>
        <li>2) didnâ€™t feel like they had finished at the end,</li>
        <li>3) language, 
        <li>4) benefit questions</li> 
        <li>Users want clearer info around what part of their rent they need to tell us about, if they get help towards it.</li>
        <li>They need clearer feedback that the application has been submitted and what the next steps are. </li>
        <li>Users who are low on the digital inclusion scale could use this, but require the correct language to understand it.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="strong">Known issues: </span></li>
        <li>No error messages in the prototype.</li>
        <li>No feedback when sections are done.</li>
        <li>Uses dummy data on summary screens.</li>
        <li>Users don't understand benefits and use different names for them. </li>
        <li>We need to understand how often people pay for things like rent and be more explicit about monthly, four weekly vs calendar month.</li>
      </ul>
