      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>Overall, users found this easy to use.</li> 
        <li>Biggest issues were around:</li> 
        <li>1) known issues below</li>
        <li>2) didnâ€™t feel like they had finished at the end,</li>
        <li>3) language, 
        <li>4) benefit questions.</li> 
        <li>Users want to know what part of their rent they need to tell us about, if they get help towards it.</li>
        <li>They need clear feedback that the application has been submitted and what the next steps are. </li>
        <li>Users who are low on the digital inclusion scale could use this, but require the correct language to understand it.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><span class="strong">Known issues: </span> </h3>
  
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>No error messages in the prototype.</li>
        <li>No feedback when sections are done.</li>
        <li>Uses dummy data on summary screens.</li>
        <li>Users don't understand benefits and use different names for them. </li>
        <li>We need to understand how often people pay for things like rent and be more explicit about monthly, four weekly vs calendar month.</li>
      </ul>
